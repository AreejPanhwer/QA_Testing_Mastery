**QA_Testing_Mastery**

QA_Testing_Mastery is a comprehensive project designed to master Software Quality Assurance (SQA) techniques, with a strong emphasis on manual testing. This project simulates real-world testing scenarios to ensure software reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.

**Project Overview**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate hands-on expertise in the manual testing of software applications. Through the use of industry-standard tools and methodologies, this project covers the full lifecycle of test case creation, bug tracking, and performance testing.

**Key Features:**

1- Detailed test case design and execution.
2- Thorough bug tracking and reporting using Jira.
3- API testing using Postman.
4- Real-world scenarios focusing on enhancing software performance and reliability.

**Tools & Technologies**

1- Manual Testing
2- Jira: For tracking bugs and managing issues.
3- Postman: For testing and validating APIs.
4- Excel/Google Sheets: For documenting test cases and tracking testing progress.

Test Process
Test Case Creation:
The test cases are written based on the functional requirements of the application, focusing on critical modules like login and payment systems.

Test Execution:
The tests are executed manually, with detailed test steps, expected results, and actual outcomes documented.

Bug Reporting:
All identified bugs are logged into Jira, with severity and priority assigned. Reports include reproducibility steps, expected vs. actual results, and relevant attachments such as screenshots.

API Testing:
Postman is used for API testing to validate response times, data accuracy, and endpoint behavior under different conditions.

Bug Tracking Sample
Issue: Login button unresponsive on mobile
Severity: High
Priority: Urgent
Steps to Reproduce:

Access the application on a mobile device.
Enter valid credentials.
Click the login button, which fails to respond.
Resolution: The issue was replicated across multiple devices, and the development team was alerted for a fix.

Performance Evaluation
Incorporates API performance testing using Postman. APIs were tested for speed, data consistency, and error handling.

How to Use
Clone the repository:
